# NER Model Fine-Tuning for Amharic Text in Telegram Messages

This project focuses on fine-tuning Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to extract key entities (products, prices, and locations) from Amharic text collected from Ethiopian-based e-commerce Telegram channels.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that can identify and extract entities such as products, prices, and locations from Amharic messages in Telegram. The system involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting messages from Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing and tokenizing Amharic text data to prepare it for labeling and training.
3. **Data Labeling**: Labeling the data using the CoNLL format for NER tasks.
4. **Fine-Tuning the NER Model**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model like XLM-Roberta, DistilBERT, or mBERT to recognize named entities in Amharic.
5. **Model Comparison**: Comparing different models based on performance metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, and processing time.
6. **Model Interpretability**: Using SHAP and LIME to interpret the model's predictions and enhance trust in the system.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt





Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect messages from at least five Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels.
Preprocess the text by cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing the data to prepare it for further labeling.
Labeling Data in CoNLL Format
For NER tasks, the dataset is labeled using the CoNLL format, where entities are identified and labeled as:

B-Product: The beginning of a product entity.
I-Product: Inside a product entity.
B-LOC: The beginning of a location entity.
I-LOC: Inside a location entity.
B-PRICE: The beginning of a price entity.
I-PRICE: Inside a price entity.
O: Tokens outside any entities.
Fine-Tuning the NER Model
Fine-tune a pre-trained XLM-Roberta, DistilBERT, or mBERT model using the labeled dataset in CoNLL format. The fine-tuning process involves:

Loading the dataset and tokenizing the data.
Setting up the training arguments (learning rate, epochs, batch size).
Using Hugging Face's Trainer API for model training and evaluation.
Model Comparison
Compare different models such as XLM-Roberta, DistilBERT, and mBERT based on the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Processing time
Select the best-performing model for production based on these metrics.

Model Interpretability
To ensure transparency and trust in the modelâ€™s predictions, SHAP and LIME are used to explain how the model identifies entities. These tools help in:

Understanding the impact of individual words in the prediction.
Analyzing challenging cases where the model might struggle.
Results and Conclusion
The XLM-Roberta model showed the best performance for entity extraction. Using SHAP and LIME helped improve interpretability and build trust in the predictions.
